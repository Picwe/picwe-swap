    "title": "Standard Price Sale",
    "desc": "During the Standard Price Sale, tokens will be sold at a fixed standard price. This phase is open to all participants, providing an excellent opportunity to acquire tokens at a fair value. The fixed price ensures transparency and allows investors to plan their purchases effectively. This phase is ideal for those looking to enter the PicWe community at an accessible price point."
  },
  {
    "title": "Premiium Price Sale",
    "desc": "Following the Standard Price Sale, we will transition into the Premium Price Sale. In this phase, tokens will be sold at a higher price compared to the Standard Price Sale. This increase reflects the growing demand and the value of the project as it progresses. Participants in this phase will still have the chance to invest in PicWe, albeit at a premium price."

  {
    "title": "Gain Sale List",
    "desc": "A key feature of our ICO is the Gain Sale List. This is a special list of addresses that are eligible for an enhanced token allocation. Participants on this list will benefit from a unique offer: they can purchase tokens at the same standard price during both the Standard Price Sale and the Premium Price Sale, but will receive 1.2 times the amount of tokens for their investment.<br/> This means that for every token purchased, Gain Sale List participants will receive an additional 20% in tokens, maximizing their investment potential. This benefit is designed to reward early supporters and incentivize participation in the ICO."
